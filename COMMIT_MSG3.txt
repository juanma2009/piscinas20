Fix: Use archivosPendientes directly for PASO 2 decision

The server always returns tieneArchivos=false because PASO 1 intentionally 
doesn't send files. This caused PASO 2 to never execute even when files 
were selected.

Now check archivosPendientes.length directly instead of waiting for 
server response. This fixes the issue where files are in memory but 
not uploaded to Cloudinary.
